ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I am aspect. I am a teenager in the USA and began experimenting with developing, mainly through bots on Discord, about two years ago. I currently know, but am still learrning, `discord.js`, a wrapper for the Discord API written in Javascript. I am looking to expand my knowledge through learning python and web development in the future.
